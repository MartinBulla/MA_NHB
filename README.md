## Supporting information for "Data aggregation blurs inferred temporal trends in bird sampling”  

When using this content **PLEASE CITE** our [preprint TO ADD]() and this repository[<sup>1</sup>](#1), which contains all code, data and outputs used in this replication. 

### **Content**
[Supplement with code](https://martinbulla.github.io/MA_NHB/)  

[original_paper](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/original_paper/) folder used for `Data` and `Code` subfolders, both two folders with the file structure as provided by the authors, obtained by downloading the authors' [repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8052525); note that due to copyright, we do not post the actual `Data` and `Code` subfolders, you need to download those from the authors' [repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8052525); for the actual paper with its supplements see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01688-5 

[Data](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Data/) stores furher data in folders:
- [provided](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Data/provided/) additional data shared by the authors upon the request from The Institute for Replication
- [MaPe](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Data/MaPe/) with datasets generated by our scripts; those with `DAT_glmmTMB` the sets of fitted glmmTMB models, `DAT_obs_year_polygon.zip` which contains `DAT_obs_year_polygon.csv` with number of observations per year and each polygon, and `DAT_obs_year_polygon_source.csv` contains the same, but differentiated by the source of the observations. The latter two were generated by [rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R). Note, the zip files needs unzipping as `DAT_obs_year_polygon.csv` is the key for some of the scripts. Files with `DAT_bam` prefix store fitted bam models, need to be downloaded from [Open Science Framework repository](https://osf.io/mfkan) (as GitHub does not support files >100MB) and stored in the MaPe folder for the scripts to run.

[R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/) - scripts used in the analysis:
- [_runRmarkdown.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/_runRmarkdown.R) generates the html [Supplement](https://martinbulla.github.io/MA_NHB/)from the following R-script:  
- [rep_SI_v1.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/rep_SI_v1.R) contains all scripts used to generate the paper outputs, including the display items  
- [rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R) is an adjusted author's script that saves the # of sampling observations per each polygon and year   

[Outputs](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Output/) - separate files of all outputs used in our manuscript and supplement, containing also [Model_ass](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Output/Model_ass) folder with model assumptions of all models that we fitted.
 
[LICENSE](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/LICENSE): terms of reuse - applicable only after this work is published as a preprint or in a scientific journal, until then the data are not available for reuse.
