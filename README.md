## Supporting information for "Data aggregation blurs inferred temporal trends in bird sampling”  

This Supporting Information accompanies our *Matters Arising* and provides detailed methods, results, diagnostics, and figure outputs underlying the analyses reported in the main text [@bulla_MA_2026]. 

When referring to or reusing these materials, **please cite** the corresponding [preprint](https://doi.org/10.32942/X2NS9V) and this repository [<sup>1</sup>](#1), which contains all code, data, and outputs used in this replication.

### **Content**
[Supplement with code](https://martinbulla.github.io/MA_NHB/)  

[original_paper/](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/original_paper/) - Contains the original file structure provided by the authors, including `Data` and `Code` subfolders downloade from the authors' [repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8052525). Due to copyright restrictions, these subfolders are not redistributed here and need to be obtained directly from the authors’ repository. The authors' article and its supplements are available at: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01688-5 

[Data](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Data/) - Stores additiona datasets in subfolders:    
- [provided/](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Data/provided/) with data shared by the authors upon request via the Institute for Replication.  
- [MaPe/](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Data/MaPe/) with datasets generated by our scripts: files prefixe `DAT_glmmTMB` store fitted `glmmTMB` models, `DAT_obs_year_polygon.zip` containing `DAT_obs_year_polygon.csv` (annual observation counts per polygon), and `DAT_obs_year_polygon_source.csv` providing the same data partitioned by observation source. The latter two datasets were generated uisng [rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R). Note, the ZIP needs unpacking for dependent scripts to run correctly. Files prefixed `DAT_bam` store fitted `bam` models and are hosted at [Open Science Framework repository](https://osf.io/mfkan) due to GitHub file size limits (100MB) and stored in the MaPe folder for the scripts to run; these must be downloaded and placed in the *MaPe* folder for full reproducibility.

[R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/) - scripts used in the analysis:
- [_runRmarkdown.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/_runRmarkdown.R) generates the HTML [Supporting Information](https://martinbulla.github.io/MA_NHB/) from the following R-scripts:  
- [rep_SI_v5.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/rep_SI_v5.R) contains all code used to generate the paper and Supporting Information outputs.  
- [rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/R/rev_Dat_temporal_trend_v1.R) is a modified authors' script that extracts polygon-level yearly observation counts.
#' 
[Outputs](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Output/) - separate files of all outputs used in our manuscript, including the HTML Supporting Information and [Model_ass](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/Output/Model_ass) subfolder with diagnostic outputs for all fitted models. 

[LICENSE](https://github.com/MartinBulla/MA_NHB/tree/main/LICENSE) - terms of reuse.
